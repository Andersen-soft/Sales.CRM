## Services that require customization 
Some services have default configuration that need to be changed for the application to work properly.
Without this configuration, the application will work but not all functionality will be available.
[Configuration example.](/Backend/.env.example)

1. Amazon cloud configuration(or just use ['local'](/Backend/src/main/resources/application.yml#L8) storage type): [amazon environment variables](/Backend/.env.example#L6)
2. Skype and telegram configuration for the notifications : [messaging environment variables](/Backend/.env.example#L45)
3. Email notification: [email environment variables](/Backend/.env.example#L87)
4. JWT security configuration: [JWT environment variables](/Backend/.env.example#L79)

It is also possible to create sales outside the system through a special user - 'site'.
To use this user, you need to generate a JWT token for him for authentication using an access token value from security configuration.

## Quick start
1. Сlone the repository:</br> 

    "git clone https://github.com/Andersen-soft/Sales.CRM.git"
    or
    "git clone git@github.com:Andersen-soft/Sales.CRM.git"


2. Create and configure the variable files

    Backend: ./Backend/.env
     example configuration ./Backend/example.env
    
    Frontend: ./Frontend/.env
     example configuration ./Frontend/example.env
     
     There is no additional action required if using default settings.


3. Launch: docker-compose up -d

    After installation, change the value of the variable: 
    ./Backend/src/main/resources/application.yml 
    resourcestring.datasource.initialize: "true" to "false"

    When you have built and launched the docker containers using docker-compose, it takes about 2-3 minutes for the application to start fully.

4. Check in your browser:

    frontend {IP of container launch}:8088
    
    backend {IP of container launch}:8090
    
    db {IP of container launch}:3306


5. Project deletion: 

    docker-compose down --rmi all <br />
